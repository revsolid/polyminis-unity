Thank you for downloading this package! :)
This package provide a pure procedural method to generate infinite, non-repetition starry sky texture.
Well-suited if you need render a real starry sky.

Demos include:
=> "Screen Background.unity" demonstrate how to use it on a 2D scroll background.
=> "Sky Dome.unity" demonstrate how to use it in 3D sky dome environment.

There are many shader variables exposed on material inspector panel.
Try tweak them and get the required visual appearance you like.
